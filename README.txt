Application written by Christine Talbot.

Application runs an html server via node.js.  The html pages utilized allow the user to verify the files to be used, and provides a graphical look at the different bones' distances from the root bone.  It also provides the standard deviation and mean for each bone across all the files.  Finally, it provides the ability to search those distances for patterns of differing sizes/ranges and with differing thresholds.  Patterns across multiple bones was not pursued due to the time the current process took to run certain pattern ranges and the time effect of completing this across many different combinations of bones, as javascript doesn't do well with parallelization.

To run:
-------
1) If you wish to change the files to be read, place them in the 
	Part-B/inputfiles folder.  This is restricted to a max of 6 files with 
	.txt extension.
2) Navigate to Part-B folder in terminal/command window
3) Type:
	node index.js
4) When the command window shows:
	Server has started.
   Open a browser window and enter the below URL in the URL field:
    http://localhost:8888/start
5) Verify the files to be read are correct by clicking the Confirm button 
	on the browser window.
6) The results will then appear on the browser window.
7) To analyze the results for patterns, click the "Click Here" button near 
	the top of the screen.
8) Enter the parameters for your pattern search and click the "Find" button.  
	This may take some time depending on the number of files & file size, as
	well as the size/number of patterns to find.  To find patterns of size 2 on
	the provided files for development takes approximately 20 minutes.
9) Review the results & re-enter new parameters for a new search, if desired.
10) To run with a new set of files, modify the files in the inputfiles directory
	and re-enter the url:
	 http://localhost:8888/start
11) To close, close the browser window, then return to the terminal/command 
	window and do Ctrl-C to stop the server scripts.

Files Required by Application:
==============================
1) Text file(s) with 99 floats per line (with '\n' separating the lines), 
	separated by tabs.  Up to 6? files are supported.  Sequence is assumed by
	alphabetical ordering of the file names.  File names MUST end in '.txt'.


Files Included:
===============
1) index.js - entry point for the application
2) server.js - starts the server listener for the application
3) router.js - routes the web page requests
4) requestHandlers.js - handles the page requests
5) createPages.js - generates the html and javascript files for requests
6) readfiles.js - reads the file data and performs mean and standard deviation 
	calculations on them
7) utilities.js - holds different utility functions for the application, such as
	pattern searchers, distance calculators, and value lookups
8) search.html - frame page for pattern searches
9) includes/* - 4 files for generating the line charts for the distance data
10) README.txt - this file


Files Generated by Application:
===============================
1) results.html - holds the chart and table results of the file data
2) file1chart.js - holds the javascript commands to add the appropriate series
	to the chart in the results.html page
3) hiddenform.html - holds the hidden form elements to be reused on pages to
	pass the data from the files to the next page
4) patternFinder.html - holds the query form and the results from the last
	pattern query
5) matchresults.html - holds the results from the last pattern query
